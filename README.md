## About

A POC of using both a typed theme object and component `@Inputs` with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) CSS to produce something similar to [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) with React.

This in practice would allow you to dynamically style a angular component without needing CSS classes that are matching component states as well as use libraries like [polished](https://polished.js.org/) to dynamically change styles that may depend on JS variables or even component variables.

Please feel free to fork, test, improve and build on this POC via Github.
